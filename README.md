# Buisness-Analytics-Exercises
These are my own attempt at solving some exercises in this textbook " Data Mining for Business Analytics: Concepts, Techniques, and Applications in R by Galit Shmueli et al. 2017 "

Chapter 14 exercise 2
--------------------
Identifying Course Combinations. The Institute for Statistics Education at Statistics.
com offers online courses in statistics and analytics, and is seeking information that
will help in packaging and sequencing courses. Consider the data in the file Course-
Topics.csv, the first few rows of which are shown in Table 14.13. These data are for
purchases of online statistics courses at Statistics.com. Each row represents the courses
attended by a single customer. The firm wishes to assess alternative sequencings and
bundling of courses.Use association rules to analyze these data, and interpret several
of the resulting rules.

Chapter 6 exercise 2
--------------------
Tayko Software is a software catalog firm
that sells games and educational software. It started out as a software manufacturer
170 MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
and then added third-party titles to its offerings. It recently revised its collection of
items in a new catalog, which it mailed out to its customers. This mailing yielded
2000 purchases. Based on these data, Tayko wants to devise a model for predicting
the spending amount that a purchasing customer will yield. The file Tayko.csv contains
information on 2000 purchases. ................

Chapter 9 exercise 1
---------------------

Competitive Auctions on eBay.com. The file eBayAuctions.csv contains information
on 1972 auctions that transacted on eBay.com during Mayâ€“June 2004. The goal
is to use these data to build a model that will classify auctions as competitive or noncompetitive.
A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least two bids placed
on the item auctioned. The data include variables that describe the item (auction category),
the seller (his/her eBay rating), and the auction terms that the seller selected
(auction duration, opening price, currency, day-of-week of auction close). In addition,
we have the price at which the auction closed. The task is to predict whether or
not the auction will be competitive.
Data Preprocessing. Convert variable Duration into a categorical variable. Split the
data into training (60%) and validation (40%) datasets.
