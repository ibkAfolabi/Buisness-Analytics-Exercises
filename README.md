# Buisness-Analytics-Exercises

Chapter 14 exercise 2
--------------------
Identifying Course Combinations. The Institute for Statistics Education at Statistics.
com offers online courses in statistics and analytics, and is seeking information that
will help in packaging and sequencing courses. Consider the data in the file Course-
Topics.csv, the first few rows of which are shown in Table 14.13. These data are for
purchases of online statistics courses at Statistics.com. Each row represents the courses
attended by a single customer. The firm wishes to assess alternative sequencings and
bundling of courses.
